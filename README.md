# What is this

This is an iOS application that allow users to create some "counters" to keep track of how many times they did something. The characteristic feature af this app are the so-called **checkpoints**. Checkpoints are automatic actions that are performed when a counter reaches a particular value defined by the user. With such a functionality users can create complex systems of counters to perform various automatic actions.

This app was created for the *Mobile Apps Lab* course of the University of Bologna.

## WARNING
As with many personal projects, all the code here is the result of a *RUSHED* development cycle so it could be (read: it is quite surely) a mess and badly organized. **Any contribution/comment is greatly appreciated!**

### Have a good day!
